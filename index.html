        A quadcopter, also called a quadrotor helicopter or quadrotor,[1] is a
        multirotor helicopter that is lifted and propelled by four rotors.
        Quadcopters are classified as rotorcraft, as opposed to fixed-wing
        aircraft, because their lift is generated by a set of rotors (vertically
        oriented propellers).
